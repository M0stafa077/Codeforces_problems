                    Boy or Girl
    Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums. 
So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance. 
Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty 
(he thought so). After that they talked very often and eventually they became 
a couple in the network.
    But yesterday, he came to see "her" in the real world and found out "she" 
is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to 
love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by 
their user names.

This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is 
odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. You are given the string 
that denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of 
this user by his method.

Input:
    The first line contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase 
English letters â€” the user name. This string contains at most 100 letters.

Output:
    If it is a female by our hero's method, print "CHAT WITH HER!" 
(without the quotes), otherwise, print "IGNORE HIM!" (without the quotes).

Examples:
    Input:
        wjmzbmr
    Output:
        CHAT WITH HER!  

    Input:
        sevenkplus
    Output:
        CHAT WITH HER!

    Input:
        xiaodao
    Output:   
        IGNORE HIM!
Note
    For the first example. There are 6 distinct characters in "wjmzbmr". 
These characters are: "w", "j", "m", "z", "b", "r". So wjmzbmr is a female and you 
should print "CHAT WITH HER!"
